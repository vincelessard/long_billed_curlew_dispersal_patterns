# Long-billed curlew dispersal patterns

## Questions / Objectives

### Occurrence data
1. Assess the sampling effort across the years (plot counts ~ years)
2. Map the occurrences in North America between 2013 and 2018 (dates from the GPS data)
3. Overlay with habitat and climate data
4. % habitat occupation across years
5. Shifts in ranges (derived from 95% occurrence data) over the studied years

### GPS movement data
1. a. Overlay with occurrence data
1. b. Paths characteristics: straightness, step length to assess "dispersivity"
2. a. Identify breeding, resting and foraging as well as year-round areas - assess the habitat associated with these areas
2. b. Assess number of habitats crossed over during migration
--> Compare between Idaho and Texas datasets
3. a. for each dataset, on a smaller region, assess movements and path characteristics across a gradient of habitat quality, degradation and human use.
3. b. assess connectivityand movement paths with something like circuitscape ? over the years if possible?
