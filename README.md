# Long-billed curlew dispersal patterns

### Questions / Objectives

### 1 Are birds philopatric? -> locations ~same across years?
  Analysis: Group points into summer/migration/winter/rest(?)
            Find MCPs (minimum convex polygons) around nesting/summer locations

### 2 Different phenologies between travel distances? (net displacement vs time of migration/travel speed/travel time/#of rests)

3 Commonalities of habitat type/ecogeographic classification of coast/city/other within birds between summer/winter places?
4 GPS data representative of all occurences? -> GPS data area as % of GBIF data area




### Occurrence data
(1. Assess the sampling effort across the years (plot counts ~ years))
2. Map the occurrences in North America between 2013 and 2018 (dates from the GPS data)
3. Overlay with habitat and climate data -> need those data
4. % habitat occupation across years -> GBIF/bison
5. Shifts in ranges (derived from 95% occurrence data) over the studied years

### GPS movement data
1. a. Overlay with occurrence data -> stats?
1. b. Paths characteristics: straightness, step length to assess "dispersivity" -> not informative, especially w/ heterogeneous sampling schedule
(2. b. Assess number of habitats crossed over during migration -> informative? Seems like they fly Â± straight line)
--> Compare between Idaho and Texas datasets
3. a. for each dataset, on a smaller region, assess movements and path characteristics across a gradient of habitat quality, degradation and human use.
3. b. assess connectivity and movement paths with something like circuitscape ? over the years if possible?
